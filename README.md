# SQL-Injection-Patcher

Currently we have many python based Vulnerability Scanner Tools, Penetration Testing Tools and Patch Management Tools. But we don't have any Auto Patcher tool for fix vulnerability in seconds. I developed a python based White Box Testing & Auto Patching tool that will help developer, vulnerability analyst, and also save their time, hardwork as well as reduces risk very fastly.

The objective is to make complex patching tasks complete in one click. It reduces Black Box testing time and also reduces the time to fix that vulnerability. Currently, my focus is on SQL Injection Vulnerability. No additional commands will need in this tool. It is a CLI user-friendly tool.

This tool can scan, detect, identify, and fix SQL Injection vulnerability. There is no similar tool available in the market. This is a python based tool, easy to use, and easy to deploy, no additional library required. This tool runs on Windows and Linux operating systems.

This tool has multiple options and functions. Like a create project, open project, delete the project. The user gives project name and source file path. It’s created Project in “C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\Sudarshana\\<Project_Name>”. 

The user has multiple option like “Listout”, “Automated”, “Manual”, “Back”, “Exit”.
  1.) “List” option listed Currant Working Directory all files and folder.
  2.) “Automated” option scans all PHP files and patch all that file.
  3.) “Manual” option scans selected file and patch that file.
  4.) “Back” option back to parent folder.
  5.) “Exit” option Exit from the tool.
